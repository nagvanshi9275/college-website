        <p>With well laid out superbly landscaped campuses, Poornima Group of Colleges (established in year 2000) - comprising of two institutes- Poornima College of Engineering (PCE - 2000) and Poornima Institute of Engineering and Technology (PIET- 2007), offer a unique academic environment of continuous influence and interaction considered essential for the enrichment of mind and the body.

            We recognize the abilities of our students very well and adequately educate and prepare them to harness their potential and to grow and evolve into successful professionals. The education technology forecast for 2017 onward could perhaps be described in a single word: change. We're now on an exponential pace of technological change, several technologies continue to converge and new forms of human-computer interaction are gaining visibility and traction. At Poornima, we are incorporating lessons that encourage students to solve real-world problems using available technologies across core undergraduate curriculum. We are also promoting learning both inside and outside the classroom. Our focus remains on evolving efficient, confident and knowledgeable technocrats and entrepreneurs with global thinking and futuristic mind-set that will contribute to nation building with simultaneous faith in corporate ethics.
            
            To provide quality education, Poornima Group of Colleges has a team of highly qualified and dedicated faculty members and created a physical environment that supports teaching, learning, and research. Our achievements are well reflected in excellent results, placements and successful careers of more than 43000+ alumni. I hope you will enjoy using the website and utilize the information available on it in a productive way. We very cordially invite you to visit our campuses and see for yourself how PGC is different and in seventeen years of operation it has emerged as unique Poornima Brand with excellent reputation in professional education in engineering and technology.
            
            I and all members of Poornima Family look forward to welcome you to Poornima Group of Colleges and assure you that you will have exciting educational experience to help you fulfill your dreams.
